    "In this notebook, we'll be working with the [Chinook](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) database. This database contains information about a fictional digital music store. \n",
    "\n",
    "By querying this database using sqlite, we'll attempt to obtain data driven answers to the following business questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which genres are most popular? Should we invest in recruiting upcoming artists of a particular genre?\n",
    "- Are certain employees generating more revenue than others? If so, why is this the case? \n",
    "- Should marketing campaigns aimed towards any particular country be launched? \n",
    "- Would it be valuable to our customers to add an \"album purchase\" option to our website? \n",
    "\n",
    "# Summary of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "After querying the database to generate tables answering the above questions, we concluded that:\n",
    "- The rock genre is far and away the most popular. However, it may be more valuable to invest in upcoming artists from the Metal and Alternative/Punk genres. \n",
    "- All employees seem to be generating a similar amount of revenue. Any differences are likely accounted for by time spent at the company. \n",
    "- A few countries show potential for specific marketing campaigns, but this is based on a small amount of data. Smaller campaigns should first be launched targetting these countries in an effort to increase sample size before making a bigger decision. \n",
    "- About 20% of invoices correspond to album purchases. This seems like a significant enough percentage to suggest adding an \"album purchase\" feature to the website. \n",
